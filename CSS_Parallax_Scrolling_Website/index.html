        <p>This tool rearranges the order of lines in the given textual data. It uses the Knuth method to do it, aka the
            Fisher and Yates order permutation algorithm. The behavior of the algorithm changes based on how many lines
            are shuffled at the same time. By default, it takes every single line in turn (1, 2, 3, …, n), generates a
            random number from 1 to n for it, which is the new position, and moves the line to this new place. It can
            also take several lines at once and move them together without splitting them apart. For example, if you
            enter the number 2 in the group size option, it will glue the 1st and 2nd lines together and move them
            together to a new position, then it will take the 3rd and 4th lines together, then the 5th and 6th, and so
            on. This way, you can shuffle any number of lines and preserve their relative positions. If the "Trim Lines"
            option is active, the utility removes trailing and leading whitespace in each line before shuffling them. If
            any of the lines are empty, the program can quickly delete it if the option "Skip Empty Lines" is enabled.
            Another option that can be useful is "Skip Duplicate Lines". It checks if the current line was already seen
            in the text before and if so, the application deletes this duplicate. Simple and easy!</p>
